Hi! It's Victor here, the founder of Whisper Money. You've been using the app for a few days now, and I'd love to hear how it's working for you.

## A Few Quick Questions

As a solo founder, your feedback directly shapes what I build next. I personally read every response and take your suggestions seriously. When you subscribe, you're not just supporting some big corporation - you're helping me continue building something I'm passionate about.

Whether it's a bug you've found, a feature you'd love to see, or just general thoughts - I want to hear it all. This is my project, and I care deeply about making it work well for you.
