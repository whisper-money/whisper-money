# Welcome to Whisper Money, {{ $userName }}!

Hi! I'm Victor, the founder of Whisper Money. I wanted to personally welcome you and thank you for joining us.

When I started building Whisper Money, I was frustrated with finance apps that wanted to mine my data or use AI to analyze my spending. I just wanted a simple, private way to track my finances - and I figured others might too.

## Your Data is Truly Private

I built Whisper Money with **end-to-end encryption** because I believe your financial data should be yours alone:

- Your financial data is encrypted with a key that only you control
- I cannot read your transactions, balances, or any personal information (and I don't want to!)
- Your encryption key never leaves your device

## No AI, No Data Mining

I don't use AI to analyze your spending or sell insights about your habits. Your financial data stays between you and your spreadsheet-loving self.

What's more, even if I wanted to use it, I couldn't, since you're the only one who has the key to read the data.

If you have any questions or run into any issues, **just reply to this email**. I personally read every message and I'm here to help!

Thanks for giving Whisper Money a try. It means a lot to me.

Best,<br>
Víctor F,<br>
