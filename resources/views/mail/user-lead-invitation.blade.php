# Your early access to Whisper Money is ready

Hey there!

It's Victor, the founder of Whisper Money. You signed up a while back to hear about our privacy-first personal finance app, and I'm excited to tell you - we're live!

## What is Whisper Money?

I built Whisper Money because I was tired of giving my financial data to big companies who use it for who knows what. Whisper Money keeps your data **end-to-end encrypted** - only you can see your transactions, categories, and insights. Not me, not anyone.

It's personal finance, but actually private.

## Special Founder's Offer - Just for You

As someone who believed in us early, I want to offer you something special:

<x-mail::panel>
Use code **FOUNDER** to get **$8 off** - your first month for just **$1**
</x-mail::panel>

This gets you full access to everything:

- Unlimited transaction imports
- Automated categorization rules
- Multiple account tracking
- End-to-end encrypted storage
- Mobile app (iOS & Android)

<x-mail::button :url="config('app.url') . '/register'">
Get Started for $1
</x-mail::button>

## Built by one person, for real people

I'm a solo founder building this in public. Every subscription helps me keep the lights on and build features you actually want. No investors, no board meetings, just me trying to build something useful and private.

**Have feedback? Questions? Issues?** Just hit reply to this email. I read and respond to every message personally.

Thanks for being interested in what I'm building!

Best,<br>
Víctor<br>
Founder, Whisper Money

P.S. The FOUNDER code gives you $8 off, so your first month is just $1. After that, it's $9/month. Cancel anytime, no questions asked.
